# Steganalysis using Deep Learning

Welcome to the Steganalysis using Deep Learning project! This project aims to detect hidden information within digital images using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to analyze images and classify them as either containing hidden data or not, providing valuable insights into the field of information security.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for steganalysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for preparing images for model training and evaluation.
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphs and plots to visualize model performance metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line interface to run the analysis easily.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Libraries for building and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ujwalanadella/Steganalysis-using-Deep-Learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Steganalysis-using-Deep-Learning
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies. You can do this with the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the required libraries, you can start using the project by following these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**:
   Make sure to place your training and testing images in the appropriate directories.

2. **Run the training script**:
   Execute the following command to start training the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Run the testing script**:
   After training, you can evaluate the model’s performance with:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

4. **View results**:
   The script will provide outputs on the model’s accuracy and display relevant visualizations.

## Data Sources

The project may require datasets for training and testing the deep learning models. You can use datasets such as:

- **BOSSbase**: A dataset for steganalysis, available at [BOSSbase](https://www.iarc.toshiba.com/projects/boss/).
- **Stego Images**: Generate stego images using popular steganography techniques.

Make sure to place the dataset files in the appropriate directory before running the project.
